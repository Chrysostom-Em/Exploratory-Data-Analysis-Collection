# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Collection

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** projects on various datasets. The goal is to uncover patterns, insights, and trends using data visualization and statistical analysis.

### Key Aspects of Each Analysis:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical summaries
- Visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Key insights and interpretations

This repository will be **regularly updated** with new projects, and existing analyses may be revised with additional insights.

## Repository Structure
Each dataset has a dedicated Jupyter Notebook for its EDA. The structure is as follows:
- `Online Retail Store.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis for a dataset
- `Online Retail.csv` (not included in the repository): The dataset used in the analysis

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Emigbanam/eda-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd eda-projects
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Select a project notebook and run the cells in order.

## Updates & Contributions
- New datasets and analyses will be added over time.
- Existing projects may be refined with additional insights.
- Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
